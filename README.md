# Problem Statement
For many parents the fear of leaving their child online during remote learning is a very real one. This is due to the high amount of online threats targeting children. With this new format of learning many parents and children don’t know how to protect themselves from them.

# Project Description
This GUI will be for a capture the flag style game where children will encounter different threats and find the flags based on figuring out the right answer. This aims to introduce children to different online threats such as phishing, password protection and social engineering to better prepare them for if these events happen in real life. This may also incorporate quizzes based on the exercises and a score board or report to show how well persons did.
# How it works
Players first enter ther widget and read the instructions in the How to Play tab. From here users can go to each level. These levels are built to test the knowledge of players on cybersecurity concepts such as phising emails, social engineering, etc. Once the player gets the answer right they can see their points updated.

# Inspiration
I was inspired to create this project for my honors course due to my main interest. These are my love for STEM education and cybersecurity. During this pandemic we swiftly had to switch to remote learning. This didn’t give schools or parents the opportunity to educate children on online safety. Thus I wanted to make a fun way to give children the needed information in a fun way.

# Challenges and solutions
-After using qt for the first time I had an issue where I would try to drag and drop my widgets but they wouldn’t move. I searched online and found out that this was a bug in QT and I had to move any file on my desktop to another location and it would be solved. Oddly enough this did resolve the issue and does continuously every time I have the issue.
-Linker issue, this was created when I created a slot and deleted it but didn’t remove it from the system completely. To fix this I had to find where it wasn’t deleted and delete it.
-Unable to open my file from QT.
